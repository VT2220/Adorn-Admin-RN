# Adorn Admin Panel

An admin panel made for Adorn which is an wallpaper application built with react-native. This includes actions like adding wallpapers and categories which will be displayed in app. As of now only this actions available (may be in future I will add edit and delete actions also). 

This single page admin panel is built with react-js and includes tailwand css framework, react-hook-form and redux-toolkit. (although this can be created with simple html-css-javascript)
